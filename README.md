# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Description  
This project aims to analyze student performance data to uncover insights into academic achievements across various departments. The problem at hand involves understanding key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the best and worst-performing grades, average scores for passing students, overall passing rates, and student engagement. To tackle this, Power BI was utilized to create interactive visualizations that help identify trends and patterns in the data. The insights derived from the analysis can inform academic strategies and help improve student outcomes. 

## Key Achievements  
- The analysis involved thoroughly identifying both the highest and lowest grades achieved by students across various departments, providing insights into performance disparities and departmental trends.
- It also included calculating the average score of passing students within each department and assessing the overall department-wise performance.  
- Additionally, the overall passing rate for each department and across all departments was thoroughly analyzed to uncover any discrepancies or areas needing attention.
